LSTM Sequence Prediction for Numerical Sequences
The script utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict future sequences of numerical values. It trains on historical data and forecasts future sequences based on the learned patterns.


Overview

The script consists of the following main steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loads historical sequences of numbers from a text file and preprocesses the data for LSTM training.

Data Preparation: Splits the dataset into training and validation sets, and creates input-output pairs suitable for LSTM training.

LSTM Model Architecture: Defines the architecture of the LSTM neural network, including input shape, layer configurations, and output layer.

Model Training: Compiles and trains the LSTM model on the training data, monitoring the training and validation loss.

Prediction and Forecasting: Uses the trained model to predict future sequences of numbers, visualizing the predicted sequences over time.


Requirements

Python 3.x
Libraries:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
